level 0:
https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html
so we need to use ssh command to start
to ways to use ssh 
first: ssh username@hostname -p portname
seconed : ssh hostname -l username -p portname
then the password bandit0

$ ls
we have readme
$ cat readme
now we got the pass to level one

exit 
then connet to level 1 with ssh

level 1:
https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html

$ ls -alps
now we have a file called -
so to open it with cat
$ cat ./-
so we got the pass to the level 2

exit and connect to level 2

level 2:
https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit2.html

$ ls -alps
now we have a file called spaces in this file
to read this file with space using cat
$ cat 'spaces in this filename'
so we got the pass to the level 3

exit and connect to level 3

level 3:
https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit3.html
$ ls -alps
now we have directory called inhere
$ cd inhere
when you use ls only you got nothing you need to use ls -alps
$ ls -alps
now we got .hidden
$ cat .hidden
and we got the pass to lvel 4

exit and connect to level 4

level 4:
https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit4.html
$ ls -alps
now we got inhere again
$ cd inhere
$ ls -alps
now we have a lot of files to read
but I couldn`t read it directly with cat each file has - before it 
so we need to read the file as a path
back to the home
$ cd -
$ cat /home/bandit4/inhere/-file00
now we have something but it`s not as text and it`s not what we want so we wan to read all the file in the directory but it will take sometime
so to do it in a short way
$find /home/bandit4/inhere |xargs file|grep text
the command told us there is an ASCII text inside the -file07
now use cat
$ cat /home/bandit4/inhere/-file07
we got the pass to level 5

exit and connect to level 5

level 5:
https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit6.html
we have 3 options in the file
$ find -size size 1033c
we got the path to file for example what we got xx/xx/xx
$ cat xx/xx/xx
and we got the pass to level 6

exit and connect to level 6

level 6:
https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit7.html
now we have to use ls -alps
$ ls -alps
$ cd ../    ##we got ../ to be in home dirctory
tried to find file by its username
$ find / -user bandit7
we got a lot of files , let`s dig some of it we will get one between them which the pass is there
$ cat the file
we got the pass to level 7

exit and conncet to level 7


## with some search on google we can use this line also to specify the 3 properties of the file
$ find / -type f -user bandi7 -group bandit6 -size 33c

level 7:
https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit8.html
we gonna use grep: The grep utility searches for lines which contain a search patter
$ grep [the pattren we have] *.txt

 *.txt ## mean that we search in all text files in the current directory.
so we got the pass to level 8
##here is another way using strings##
##$ strings data.txt |grep "pattren here" ##

exit and conncet to level 8

level 8:
https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit9.html

$ ls -alps
now we have data.txt and we need to find the text that occure only once
$ sort data.txt
then we can search by eye on the text that only occur one but that will take some time if the file is big
so we use another way we combine sort with uniq
$ sort data.txt | uniq -c 
where -c is to count 
we got the pass to level 9

exit and connect to level 9

level 9:
https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit10.html

$ ls -alps
also we have data.txt
$ strings data.txt |grep "==" 
we got the pass to level 10

exit and connect to level 10

level 10:
https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit11.html
$ ls -alps
we have data.txt encoded
we gonna use base64 to encode the date
$ cat data.txt | base64 -d
we got the pass to level 11

exit and conncet to level 11

level 11:
https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit12.html
$ ls -alps
we have data.txt
but lettters have been rotated by 13 positions
so we gonna used tr command
$cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'

or we can use this site https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/
so we can see the pass

we got the pass to level 12 

exit and connect to level 12

level 12:
https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit13.html
level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed

better to watch this vid >> youtube.com/watch?v=n4tROT45ipU&list=PLBf0hzazHTGOIn_vuuuCzRFVhYiDBnJID&index=3

level 13:
https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit14.html
we have a localhost to the level 14 where the pass is there , so we use ssh
ssh -i identiyfile username@localhost 
$ ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
now we are in bandit14
read there file mentioned in the link
$ cat
we got the pass

Level 14:
https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit15.html
we gonna use netcat here to access to the network on port 3000
$ nc localhost 3000
enter the pass for the level 14
now we got the pass

level 15:
